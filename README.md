# Skydiving Game

Welcome to **Skydiving Game**! In this exciting game, you control a skydiver as they freefall through the sky, dodging obstacles and aiming to land safely on the target. Your objective is to survive as long as possible and get the best score!

## Game Objective

## How to Play

- **Control the skydiver** using the arrow keys or WASD keys to steer left or right during freefall.
- **Avoid obstacles** like birds, clouds, and planes that are randomly generated in your path.
- **Deploy parachute** by pressing the **spacebar** when you're near the ground to slow your descent.
- **Land safely** on the target zone to score points.
- **Get the highest score** by landing safely multiple times.
