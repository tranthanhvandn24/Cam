# Flappy Bird Game

Welcome to **Flappy Bird**! This is a simple yet addictive game where you control a bird trying to fly through a series of pipes without hitting them. Try to achieve the highest score by navigating the bird through the pipes as long as you can.

## Game Objective

The goal of the game is to control a bird that continuously falls due to gravity. The player must tap the screen (or press space) to make the bird fly upward. Avoid hitting pipes, or the game ends. The more pipes you pass, the higher your score becomes.

## How to Play

- **Press the spacebar (or tap the screen)** to make the bird flap its wings and move upwards.
- **Avoid the pipes!** The bird must fly between the pipes without touching them.
- **Get the highest score possible** by flying through as many pipes as you can.
